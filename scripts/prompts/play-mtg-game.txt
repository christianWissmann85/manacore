Play a complete Magic: The Gathering game using the ManaCore MCP tools.

Game Configuration:
- Your deck: {deck}
- Opponent: {opponent} bot

Instructions:
1. Start with manacore_start_game(opponent="{opponent}", myDeck="{deck}")
2. Use manacore_get_game to see state AND legal actions together (saves tokens)
3. Play strategically until the game ends
4. For EVERY action, provide reasoning in the "reasoning" parameter explaining WHY you chose this move

Strategy Guidelines:
- Prioritize mana development (play a land each turn if possible)
- Cast creatures on curve - don't hold mana unnecessarily
- Attack when you have favorable trades or the opponent can't block effectively
- Hold back blockers when facing lethal or unfavorable attacks
- Consider card advantage (drawing cards, making opponent discard)
- Consider board presence (creature count, total power/toughness)

Reasoning Format:
When calling manacore_play_action, always include a reasoning parameter like:
- "Play Forest to develop mana for Giant Spider next turn"
- "Cast Llanowar Elves for mana acceleration"
- "Attack with all creatures - opponent has no blockers"
- "Hold back Giant Spider to block their flyer"
- "End turn - no profitable attacks available"

Continue playing until you see "Game Over" in the response. The game will save training data automatically.
